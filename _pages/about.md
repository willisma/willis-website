I'm a senior student in Honors Mathematics and Computer Science at NYU Courant, where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Saining Xie](https://www.sainingxie.com/) and work with [Mark Goldstein](https://marikgoldstein.github.io/), [Michael Albergo](http://malbergo.me/), [Nick Boffi](https://nmboffi.github.io/), and [Eric Vanden-Eijnden](https://wp.nyu.edu/courantinstituteofmathematicalsciences-eve2/).

I'm broadly interested in Computer Vision, with a particular focus on measure transport in generative modeling. Here are some directions that I'm recently exploring:

**Cross-domain Generation:** solve measure transport between arbitrary densities to extend the scope of vision generative models beyond noise-to-image and to other modalities (speech-to-image, text-to-speech, etc.). 

**Resolving Real-world Problem with Limited Data:** understand and leverage the knowledge learned by pre-trained vision generative models to approach various vision tasks in few- or zero-shot manners. 

**Long Form Video Generation:** enhance the fidelity and consistency of video generation models, and further extend the spatiotemporal scale beyond the *seconds* scope. 

Besides academics, I enjoy my leisure time in outdoor activities: basketball, hiking, and snowboarding (very new to this!), and I love using my camera to record moments of life. I'm also on my way to collecting playbooks of all Broadway shows (got six now!), and my favorite so far is *Come from Away*. 

Here is my [CV](assets/pdf/CV.pdf).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
