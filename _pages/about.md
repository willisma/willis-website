I'm a first-year PhD student at NYU Courant advised by [Saining Xie](https://www.sainingxie.com/) 

I'm broadly interested in Computer Vision, with a particular focus on measure transport in generative modeling. I'm currently working on video generation, especially on improving the latent representation and achieving long form consistency.

Besides academics, I enjoy outdoor activities: basketball, hiking, and snowboarding (very new to this!), and I like photography. I'm also on my way to collecting playbooks of all Broadway shows and stcikers from all National Parks.

Here is my [CV](assets/pdf/Resume.pdf).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
